  id: 1
  short: This section provides basic information retrieved from UniProtKB and MEROPS. Protein names and species and, if applicable, protease classification and isoforms are listed. The UniProtKB curated annotation is presented alongside the amino acid sequence. For further background information, links to the appropriate entries at UniProtKB and MEROPS are provided.
x1:
  name: p-domains
  id: 2
  short: The linear organization of termini, cleavage sites and stable chains as well as features and domains along the primary protein sequence is graphically represented. Moving the mouse over an element will provide additional information such as exact position, type and description.
x2:

  short: By default, all known data is incorporated into the results page. This can be customized through a filter accessible at the top right of the page. After filtering, only data that is backed with evidence matching the given filter settings is incorporated. This will affect the termini, cleavage sites and substrates listed. Also the network view will only consider matching connections and the cleavage site preference is only built on data matching the criteria.
